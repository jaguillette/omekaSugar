Omeka Sugar is a collection of useful pointers and tools to help get new users of Omeka up and running quickly. There are quick tutorials on the basics of Omeka, and some useful tools, like a [coordinate converter for Neatline]({% site.baseurl %}/coords). The name comes from the idea that a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, and these "spoonfuls of knowledge" help make working with Omeka easier. It supplements, but doesn't replace, the [official Omeka documentation](http://omeka.org/codex/Documentation).
