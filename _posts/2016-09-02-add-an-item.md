Items are the building blocks of Omeka. They're the basic pieces of content that you'll arrange into whatever narratives you make in your Omeka site. So it's important that you know how to create them!

We're starting from the admin dashboard, the first screen you'll see when you log in to an Omeka site. To make a new item, go to "Items" in the sidebar, and make a new one.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.06% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/plushexcitableekaltadeta?autoplay=0&controls=1&hd=1' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/plushexcitableekaltadeta">via Gfycat</a></p>

Omeka uses the [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/metadata-basics/) metadata standard, which has a lot of terms, but you don't have to use any of them! Of course, it's good to give your items a title, and where you'll be using your items to represent scholarly sources, you'll want to use the most complete description you can.

You'll often want to add files to your items, which you can do from the menu bar below the page title. Omeka supports most image file formats, and [many formats for media files](https://omeka.org/codex/Media_Files).

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.06% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/HalfUnlinedIndianhare?autoplay=0&controls=1&hd=1' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/halfunlinedindianhare">via Gfycat</a></p>

You might also want to tag your items, to group them together. You can add tags from the same menu bar where you add files. Separate different tags with commas when adding them.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.06% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/openjealousadmiralbutterfly?autoplay=0&controls=1&hd=1' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/openjealousadmiralbutterfly">via Gfycat</a></p>

That's it, now you have a basic Omeka Item.
